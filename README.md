P for pause, Q for quit, M for mute.

Mouse to aim, left click for regular shot, right click for burst shot. SPACE for
nuke.

The firepower meter restricts weapon usage.

# Installation

Tested with Python 2.5 and 2.6. Should work with 2.7. Untested on 3.x. The only
dependency except Python is pygame. Install it through your package manager, or
download from http://pygame.org/download.shtml. Only tested with pygame 1.9.1,
but older releases might also work. Next, simply run spaceswarm.py. Have fun!

## Mac OS X

The easiest way for now is to install Python from
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6-macosx10.3.dmg and Pygame
from http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1release-py2.6-macosx10.5.zip
