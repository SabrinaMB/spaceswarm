# Space Swarm!

A simple arcade game created with pygame.

For code, issues, or suggestions for improvement, visit the project site at
http://github.com/bmaland/spaceswarm

# Instructions

Tested with Python 2.6.6. Should work with 2.7.x, not sure about 3.x. The only
dependency except Python is pygame. Install it through your package manager, or
download from http://pygame.org/download.shtml. Only tested with version 1.9.1,
but older releases might also work. Next, simply run spaceswarm.py. Have fun!

## Mac OS X

The easyest way for now is to install Python from
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6-macosx10.3.dmg and Pygame
from http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1release-py2.6-macosx10.5.zip
